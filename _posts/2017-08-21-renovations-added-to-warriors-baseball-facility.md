#Renovations at Warriors Baseball Facility

**HOUSTON, TX -** The Houston Warriors Baseball Academy has recently added some drastic renovations.  Over the past few months, we have been working tirelessly on designing a strength and conditioning area for our athletes.  The Warriors have transformed an area in the facility that now serves as our [Warriors Weight Room](https://www.houstonwarriors.org/weight-room)!

With brand-new professional equipment, we can help our players' take their game to heights higher than before!
The addition includes:
- multiple workout racks & benches
- exercise bikes
- free weights
- two challenge ropes
- massage balls
- boxes
- kettle-bells
- and so much more!


This new area will be ran by **Travis Portillo** who has been trainer for last 9 years at LA Fitness, Edge Performance, Genesis Athletics, and Warriors Baseball Academy.  For the last 3 years, he has worked specifically with baseball athletes.  He has certifications as an *Athletic Trainer*, *Olympic Weight Lifting Coach*, *Fitness Nutrition Specialist*, and is **Certified with the National Academy of Sports Medicine.**

The Warriors have also renovated our lobby area by repainting the interior and putting down new flooring.  We find it important that our parents have a comfortable area to relax while their kids are in our facility getting better!
